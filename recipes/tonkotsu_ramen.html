<h2><u>Instructions</u></h2>
<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Pork Bone Broth</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Blanch the Bones: Place the pork bones in a large pot, cover with water, and bring to a boil for 10 minutes. This helps remove impurities. Drain and rinse the bones under cold water.</li>
    <li>Simmer the Broth: Return the cleaned bones to the pot and add 8 cups (2L) of fresh water. Add the onion, garlic, ginger, leeks, and shiitake mushrooms. Simmer uncovered on low heat for 10-12 hours, adding more water as needed to keep the bones submerged. The broth should become thick and milky.</li>
    <li>Strain the Broth: Remove the bones and strain the broth through a fine mesh sieve. Discard the solids. Stir in soy sauce, mirin, and salt to taste. Keep warm.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 2: Make the Chashu Pork</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Prepare the Marinade: In a small pot, combine soy sauce, mirin, sake, sugar, garlic, and ginger. Bring to a gentle simmer.</li>
    <li>Cook the Pork: Add the rolled pork belly to the pot and cook over low heat, turning occasionally, for about 1.5 hours.</li>
    <li>Cool & Slice: Let the pork cool in the marinade, then slice into thin rounds before serving.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 3: Make the Garlic Oil (Mayu)</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Heat vegetable oil in a small pan over medium-low heat.</li>
    <li>Add minced garlic and stir constantly until the garlic turns dark brown (but not burnt).</li>
    <li>Strain the oil and set aside for drizzling on the ramen.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 4: Prepare the Soft-Boiled Eggs</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Bring a pot of water to a gentle boil and add the eggs. Boil for 6.5 minutes for a soft, jammy yolk.</li>
    <li>Transfer the eggs to an ice bath for 5 minutes. Peel and slice in half before serving.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 5: Cook the Ramen Noodles</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Boil a pot of water and cook the fresh ramen noodles according to the package instructions (usually 2-3 minutes).</li>
    <li>Drain and rinse lightly with warm water to remove excess starch.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 6: Assemble the Ramen Bowls</h3>
<ul>
    <li>In each bowl, add 1-2 tablespoons of ramen tare (seasoning sauce).</li>
    <li>Ladle the hot tonkotsu broth into the bowl, stirring to mix with the tare.</li>
    <li>Add the cooked ramen noodles, arranging them neatly in the broth.</li>
    <li>Top with slices of chashu pork, a soft-boiled egg, green onions, nori, and bamboo shoots if using.</li>
    <li>Drizzle with garlic oil for extra depth of flavor.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 7: Serve & Enjoy!</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Serve immediately while hot, and enjoy this homemade Tonkotsu Ramen with a side of gyoza or Japanese pickles for the full experience!</li>
